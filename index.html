      <p class="subtitle">A major in Information: UX/UI Focus</p>
      <p class="infodump">

        The Bachelor of Science in Information is an upper-level undergraduate degree program at the University of Michigan that offers an interdisciplinary education on the intersection of people and technology. To quote the BSI website, “BSI graduates leave the program understanding both how to create data and technology and how to make them work for real people”.
        <br>
My focus is UX/UI because despite my introverted nature I’m a people pleaser and I like creating things with a tangible positive affect on others. While I find bad UIs endlessly entertaining to complain about, I fully believe that good UIs should go unnoticed.

      <p class="subtitle">A minor in Global Media Studies</p>
      <p class="infodump">

        My choice in minor reflects my longstanding interest in media and how it not only reflects cultures but influences the beliefs and experiences of individuals.
<br>
According to the UMich, “The coursework in this minor provides students with the opportunity to reflect on the expansive geographical scope and cultural diversity of film and moving image electronic media (television, single-camera video, digital).”
<br><br>
This is just a roundabout way of saying that I think movies are important, tv is important, and social media is important even though I hate using it.

    <p class="projDes">
      Perks is a website inspired by the many hours I spent online as a dedicated Youtube watcher and podcast listener during the ongoing quarantine. Many of my favorite content creators make deals with brands to sponsor their content and bring special offers to their audience. However,  as someone subscribed to over 50 channels it’s difficult to remember who had that sweet sweet VPN discount code or in which video someone mentioned their loot box partnership.
<br>
Perks seeks to make saving money and supporting your favorites easier than ever by compliling sponsorships and discount information in one place. Perks also has a pretty sick vaporwave aesthetic because I like it and I said so.
